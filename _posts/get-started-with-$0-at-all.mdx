Though you might think it is difficult or impossible to build a website! Don't be affraid of it! Building a website seems to be easier than the difficult math problems. So cheer up! I can give you my suggestions and experience on how to build a website.

You are browsing my website and it is a open-source project on GitHub. You can find it by open your broser, type *https://www.github.com/Cloudflare233/www* and press enter! What I wonna tell you is, I haven't learned how to "truly" code, even one day! I just keep on looking through the others' website and research their codes on GitHub, search for information which is useful to me and I could understand on Microsoft Bing and Wikipedia.

If you open GitHub and type "next-blog-starter" now. You can see plenty of repos about "next-blog-starter" which means you are a nextjs-starter and want to build a website but you don't want to spend much time on it and save time to do more things. This is what I look like 2 years ago. At that time, I was still using Hexo which is a tool can create static blog just in time. And I posted a lot of articles with GitHub Pages, and now, most of them are lost. But one and half years ago, I gotta know next.js and vercel. I try to build my own by using these two guys. As you can imagine, It was ugly and awful, like a "garbage" or worse than it.

Anyway, if you read the passages above carefully. You should know what I mean. I mean that you can consider my website as a beautiful starter and build your own on it! It shouldn't be paid.

>By the way, if you want to give money to me, I will never refuse it!
