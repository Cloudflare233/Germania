St. Patrick’s Day is a big deal in our house. “Leprechauns” sneak in the night before to raid our kitchen cabinets. Sometimes they write things in green paint on our walls; other times they leave gold coins. And my daughter always tries to catch one in her latest handmade trap (spoiler alert: it’s never happened). This is also one of the busiest weekends of the year for us. My daughter is an Irish dancer, and over St. Patrick’s Day weekend, our schedule is jam packed with parades and multiple performances at local pubs where there’s lots of dancing, drinking, and good ole reveling in Irish culture. What always concerns me, though, is the number of people who walk out of those pubs right into their cars after an afternoon of drinking.

Did you know that nearly 29 people die each day in the United States in alcohol-impaired driving crashes? That’s one person every 50 minutes, or more than 10,000 people a year. Alcohol-impaired driving crashes are 100% preventable. It’s simple. Choose one: drink or drive. Don’t do both.

This Sunday, you may be tempted to think: well, it’s just one drink, or it’s just two. Although the current legal definition of alcohol impairment in 49 states is a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08% (0.05% in Utah, thanks to the efforts of the NTSB), research shows that impairment begins at much lower levels; even small amounts of alcohol affect the brain and human performance behind the wheel.

So, this St. Patrick’s Day, we want you to have fun. And the best way to do that is to have a plan in place before you start to celebrate. Leave the driving to someone who’s sober or take transit, call a cab or a rideshare service, but please don’t drink and drive.
